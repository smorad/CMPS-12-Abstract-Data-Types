*****************************************************************

Notes that would normally not be put in the file:

A `.c' file always includes its own header.

The `struct' definition itself is specified in the
implementation file.  Everything declared in the implementation
file is `private'.  Never put field definitions in a header
file.

A tag string is defined so that each structure can be identified
at runtime similar to the way that `System.identityHashCode' in
Java can identify the type of the object.  It is also cleared
out when freed to permit checking of dangling pointers.

The tag is static so it can't be accessed outside of this file.
Static variables work as in Java if one considers the `.c' file
to be a class.

The function memset(3) is used before free(3C) in order to avoid
having pointers into the object remain live and also to prevent
a dangling pointer from verifying true for `is_intx'.  It also
can be used for checking up on types when using `void*' for
`Object'.

All functions assert is_intx as a precondition if appropriate.
